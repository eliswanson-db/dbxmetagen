variables:
  app_deployment_type:
    description: |
      Type of app deployment. 
      - USER means that when the app deploys, the app service principal will have CAN MANAGE RUN on the jobs, but the jobs run as the deploying user. 
      - SPN means that the jobs will be created by the app service principal on first job run and CAN MANAGE RUN granted to the app user.
      The distinction is very important. 
        - In the first situation, the deploying user or SPN will have CAN MANAGE RUN on the jobs, but the jobs run as the deploying user.
        - In the second situation, the jobs will be created by the app service principal on first job run and CAN MANAGE RUN granted to the app user. 
        - Once On-Behalf-Of is available for job runs there will be an option added to deploy the app with OBO enabled, and this will be the default.
