🎯 BALANCED SECURITY RECOMMENDATION

SECURITY REALITY CHECK:
✅ GLiNER package has real vulnerabilities (not theoretical)
✅ Your Databricks environment provides good isolation
✅ Performance on medical text likely significantly better than general models
✅ Risk is manageable with proper controls

DECISION FRAMEWORK:

IF performance difference > 0.1 F1 points:
   → GLiNER acceptable WITH strong security controls
   → Implement network isolation, monitoring, version pinning
   → Document risk acceptance and mitigation plan

IF performance difference < 0.05 F1 points:  
   → Consider alternatives (spaCy+scispaCy, BioBERT)
   → Security risk not justified for minimal performance gain

IF performance difference 0.05-0.1 F1 points:
   → Business decision based on:
     - Criticality of NER accuracy for your use case
     - Security team risk tolerance
     - Resources available for ongoing security monitoring

RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES TO EVALUATE:
1. spaCy + scispaCy (good medical performance, better security)
2. BioBERT via HuggingFace (high medical performance, better security)  
3. Stanza biomedical models (academic backing, good performance)

BOTTOM LINE:
The security concerns are REAL but MANAGEABLE. The decision should be based on:
1. Actual performance difference (run the comparison notebook)
2. Your organization's risk tolerance
3. Resources available for security controls

This is a legitimate engineering tradeoff, not a clear-cut security issue.
