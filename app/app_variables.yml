variables:
  deploying_user:
    description: User who deploys the asset bundle (for notebook paths). Must match the deploying_user in variables.yml.
    default: ${workspace.current_user.userName}
  app_deployment_type:
    description: |
      Type of app deployment. Only SPN is currently fully supported.
      - SPN means that jobs are created by the app service principal with proper permissions for the app user.
      - Jobs are reused across runs for better resource management and concurrent execution.
      - Max 10 concurrent runs with queue of 10 for each user's job.
      - Post-job grants are applied to give app users read access to created schemas and tables.
      
      NOTE: OBO (On-Behalf-Of) deployment will be added when jobs.jobs scope becomes available to non-account admins.
      This will allow jobs to run with the logged-in user's permissions instead of service principal permissions.
